                    <div class="newspaper">
                    My name is Justin Gibbs and I am from Wendell, North Carolina. I am currently enrolled at Wake Tech Community College hoping to become a web designer and developer. I spend a lot of my time on computers and have always enjoyed using them. I would consider myself as an introvert because I am inside most of the time just spending plenty of time on my computer. When I am not inside, I do enjoy going to the beach and spending time with family or friends. I am also shy and really like to do most things on my own, so I didn't really know what I would do for the rest of my life. Until I heard about web design and developing.
                    I have heard and read that for the most part you are working on your own but you do work with teams to discuss new ideas and also talk to clients about what they are looking for. Which I think I can handle all of that pretty well. I would say I am good with people when I do have to speak, but for the most part I do like to work on my own and go at my own pace.
